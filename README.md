## 👨‍💻 About Me

```ts
const harsh = {
  experience: "6+ years",
  focus: [
    "Backend Architecture",
    "Microservices & Event-Driven Systems",
    "Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)",
    "Real-time Streaming & Orchestration"
  ],
  currentlyWorkingOn: [
    "On-demand game streaming infrastructure",
    "gRPC & Temporal-based systems",
    "Production-ready NestJS tooling"
  ],
  strengths: [
    "System design",
    "Failure recovery",
    "Performance optimization",
    "Cost-efficient cloud architecture"
  ],

};
```

I specialize in **designing, building, and operating complex backend systems** — from **microservices and permission platforms** to **GPU-backed real-time streaming infrastructure**.

I care deeply about:

* Reliability over hype
* Clean abstractions
* Automation over manual ops
* Observability and recovery by design
* **AI-augmented programming for speed, accuracy, and scale**

I am fully adept at **AI-augmented development workflows**, leveraging modern AI tools to:

* Accelerate system design and implementation
* Validate architectural decisions
* Refactor complex codebases safely
* Explore multiple solution paths efficiently

AI is treated as a **force multiplier**, not a replacement — enabling higher-quality engineering with faster iteration cycles.
